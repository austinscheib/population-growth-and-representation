The purpose of this project was to see if there was an identifiable 
relationship between the presence of fast-growing cities in a congressional 
district and that congressional district’s voter turnout. I was motivated to 
see if the presence of these fast-growing cities in Texas’ congressional 
districts was impacting election results, being that I am from a congressional 
district experiencing a large increase in population.

I found generally inconclusive results when I plotted white-only population 
percentages against vote percentages for Republican candidates in contested 
elections. This did not surprise me, given the variance in patterns I 
observed through the line plots generated throughout this project, and given 
what I know about various other variables than can impact election results.
